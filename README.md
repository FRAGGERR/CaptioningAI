# Image Captioning Web App

This is a simple web application for generating captions for images using a pre-trained model. The application is built using Gradio for the web interface and the `transformers` library for the image captioning model.

## Installation

To run this application, you need to have Python installed on your system. Then, install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install gradio numpy pillow transformers torch
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the script.

2. Run the script using Python:

```bash
python app.py
```

3. A Gradio interface will launch in your web browser. You can upload an image, and the app will generate a caption for it.

## Code

Here's the main code for the application:

```python
import gradio as gr
import numpy as np
from PIL import Image
from transformers import Blip2Processor, Blip2ForConditionalGeneration

def caption_image(image):
    processor = Blip2Processor.from_pretrained("Salesforce/blip2-opt-2.7b")
    model = Blip2ForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained("Salesforce/blip2-opt-2.7b")
    
    inputs = processor(images=image, return_tensors="pt")
    output = model.generate(**inputs)
    caption = processor.decode(output[0], skip_special_tokens=True)
    
    return caption

iface = gr.Interface(
    fn=caption_image, 
    inputs=gr.components.Image(type="pil"), 
    outputs=gr.components.Textbox(),
    title="Image Captioning",
    description="This is a simple web app for generating captions for images using a trained model."
)

iface.launch()
```

## Notes

- Ensure you have a stable internet connection as the model files will be downloaded when you run the script for the first time.
- This application uses the `Salesforce/blip2-opt-2.7b` model from the Hugging Face model hub.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Errors

- **AttributeError: module 'gradio' has no attribute 'inputs'**: This error occurs due to the use of an outdated API in the Gradio library. The `gr.inputs` module has been deprecated in favor of the newer `gr.components` module. Update the code to use `gr.components` as shown above.
- **ImportError: Blip2ForConditionalGeneration requires the PyTorch library**: Ensure that PyTorch is installed in your environment. Install it using `pip install torch`.
